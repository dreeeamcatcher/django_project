# This file defines translations one by one (comments can be added for readability starting with
# '#' character). Format for single translation is as follows:
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# * Translation id: one or more lines (if id contains new line characters)
#
# # Zero or more lines: text - originally given in source code with formatting suggestions
#
# One or more lines - translation. Line breaks will be ignored and can be put in translations for
# readability - if line break is intended deliberately, line must end with '\n' character sequence.
#
# Empty line to terminate single translation

* defaultAuthenticationPlugin.title
New default authentication plugin considerations

* defaultAuthenticationPlugin.description
# Warning
Warning: The new default authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' offers more secure password
hashing than previously used 'mysql_native_password' (and consequent improved client connection
authentication). However, it also has compatibility implications that may affect existing MySQL
installations.  If your MySQL installation must serve pre-8.0 clients and you encounter
compatibility issues after upgrading, the simplest way to address those issues is to reconfigure
the server to revert to the previous default authentication plugin (mysql_native_password). For
example, use these lines in the server option file:\n
\n
[mysqld]\n
default_authentication_plugin=mysql_native_password\n
\n
However, the setting should be viewed as temporary, not as a long term or permanent solution,
because it causes new accounts created with the setting in effect to forego the improved
authentication security.\n
If you are using replication please take time to understand how the authentication plugin changes
may impact you.
